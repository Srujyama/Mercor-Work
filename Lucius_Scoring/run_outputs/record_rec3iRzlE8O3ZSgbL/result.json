      "output_text": "Of course. Here is a series of AP World History-style Short Answer Questions (SAQs) focused on European nationalism in the mid-to-late 19th century. The set is designed to mirror the structure of the AP exam, with a mix of stimulus-based and no-stimulus questions.\n\n---\n\n### **Instructions**\n\nAnswer all parts of every question. Use complete sentences; an outline or bulleted list alone is not acceptable. You must use specific historical evidence to support your answers.\n\n---\n\n### **Question 1 is based on the following secondary source.**\n\n“The nationalism that triumphed in Europe after 1850 was not the romantic, utopian, and liberal nationalism of the 1848 revolutionaries. Instead, it was a new, pragmatic, and conservative force, often referred to as *Realpolitik*. Leaders like Count Cavour in Piedmont-Sardinia and Otto von Bismarck in Prussia were not driven by ideals of universal brotherhood but by the calculated pursuit of state power. They co-opted nationalist sentiment, previously a tool of liberals and radicals, and harnessed it for the purpose of state-building from the top down. Through shrewd diplomacy, industrial mobilization, and decisive warfare, these statesmen forged unified nations not on the basis of popular will alone, but through ‘blood and iron.’”\n\n**Source: Adapted from various historical analyses of 19th-century European nationalism.**\n\n**A.** Identify ONE argument the author makes about the nature of European nationalism after 1850.\n**B.** Explain ONE specific historical example of a leader using “shrewd diplomacy” or “decisive warfare” to achieve nationalist goals in the period 1850-1880.\n**C.** Explain ONE way in which the “liberal nationalism” of the period before 1850 differed from the state-building nationalism described in the passage.\n\n---\n\n### **Question 2 is based on the following maps of Europe.**\n\n**Map 1: Europe in 1848**\n\n\n**Map 2: Europe in 1880**\n\n\n**A.** Identify ONE major political change in Central Europe shown on the maps between 1848 and 1880.\n**B.** Explain ONE way in which nationalism was the primary cause of the political change you identified in Part A.\n**C.** Explain ONE effect of the rise of nationalism, as reflected in the maps, on a multi-ethnic empire (such as the Austrian or Ottoman Empire) during this period.\n\n---\n\n### **Question 3 is a no-stimulus question.**\n\n**A.** Identify ONE cultural element (e.g., language, religion, art) that was used to promote a sense of national identity in a European state during the period 1800-1900.\n**B.** Explain ONE way that industrialization contributed to the growth of nationalism in a European state in the period 1800-1900.\n**C.** Explain ONE way that nationalism contributed to the development of European imperialism in the late 19th century.\n\n---\n---\n\n### **Scoring Guidelines and Example Answers**\n\n#### **Question 1: Scoring Guidelines**\n\n*   **A. (1 point):** Correctly identifies an argument from the passage, such as nationalism after 1850 being conservative, pragmatic, state-driven, or a \"top-down\" force.\n*   **B. (1 point):** Provides a specific historical example of a leader using diplomacy or war for nationalist ends AND explains the connection.\n*   **C. (1 point):** Explains a clear difference between pre-1850 liberal nationalism and post-1850 conservative nationalism.\n\n**Example High-Scoring Response:**\n\n**A.** The author argues that nationalism after 1850 became a conservative and pragmatic force, used by state leaders from the \"top-down\" to increase state power, rather than a \"bottom-up\" liberal movement.\n\n**B.** Otto von Bismarck of Prussia exemplifies the use of \"decisive warfare\" to achieve nationalist goals. He provoked the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) by editing the Ems Telegram, which inflamed French and German public opinion. The subsequent Prussian victory over France rallied the southern German states behind Prussia, leading directly to the proclamation of the unified German Empire in 1871, thus using war as a direct tool for state-building.\n\n**C.** The \"liberal nationalism\" before 1850, seen in the Revolutions of 1848, was different because it was often linked to demands for constitutional government, individual rights, and popular sovereignty. These liberal nationalists, like students and intellectuals in the Frankfurt Assembly, sought to create a unified Germany through a constitution and democratic process, whereas Bismarckian nationalism prioritized the power of the monarchy and the state over liberal ideals.\n\n#### **Question 2: Scoring Guidelines**\n\n*   **A. (1 point):** Correctly identifies a political change from the maps, such as the unification of Germany or the unification of Italy.\n*   **B. (1 point):** Explains how nationalism (e.g., shared culture, language, desire for self-determination) drove the specific change identified.\n*   **C. (1 point):** Explains a specific effect of nationalism on a multi-ethnic empire, such as leading to separatist movements, political instability, or reforms like the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867.\n\n**Example High-Scoring Response:**\n\n**A.** One major political change shown on the maps is the unification of the previously fragmented German states into a single, large German Empire by 1880.\n\n**B.** This unification was caused by Prussian-led nationalism, which promoted the idea that all German-speaking peoples should belong to a single state. Prussia, under Bismarck, harnessed this sentiment by fighting three wars—against Denmark, Austria, and France—that stirred nationalist fervor and demonstrated Prussian military and economic strength, ultimately convincing other German states to unify under Prussian leadership.\n\n**C.** The rise of nationalism had a destabilizing effect on the multi-ethnic Austrian Empire. As Germans and Italians formed their own nations, other ethnic groups within Austria's borders, such as Hungarians, Czechs, and Slavs, began to demand more autonomy or independence. This pressure forced the Austrian government to make concessions, most notably the Compromise of 1867, which created the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary to appease Hungarian nationalism but ultimately failed to solve the demands of other ethnic minorities.\n\n#### **Question 3: Scoring Guidelines**\n\n*   **A. (1 point):** Correctly identifies a specific cultural element used to promote national identity.\n*   **B. (1 point):** Explains a specific link between industrialization and nationalism.\n*   **C. (1 point):** Explains a specific link between nationalism and imperialism.\n\n**Example High-Scoring Response:**\n\n**A.** In Germany, a shared language and the collection of folk tales by figures like the Brothers Grimm were used to create a common cultural heritage and promote a sense of a unified German identity long before a political state existed.\n\n**B.** Industrialization contributed to the growth of nationalism in Germany by creating economic interconnectedness that preceded political unity. For example, the *Zollverein*, or German Customs Union established by Prussia, removed tariffs between German states. This created an integrated economic zone, making merchants and industrialists realize the benefits of a single, unified nation-state to protect and expand their markets.\n\n**C.** Nationalism fueled European imperialism in the late 19th century by creating intense rivalries between nation-states for global prestige. Acquiring colonies was seen as a measure of national strength and a symbol of being a \"great power.\" For instance, the \"Scramble for Africa\" was driven not just by economic motives but by a competitive rush where nations like Germany, France, and Great Britain sought to plant their flag on territory to prove their superiority and prevent rivals from gaining an advantage."

Prussia must concentrate its strength and hold it for the favorable moment, which has already come and gone several times. Since the treaties of Vienna, our frontiers have been ill-designed for a healthy body politic.

Key ethnic groups shown would include Germans, Magyars (Hungarians), Czechs, Poles, Slovaks, Romanians, Serbs, Croats, and Italians.)*\n\n**(A) Identify one specific ethnic group shown on the map that did not have its own independent state within the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1910.**\n\n**(B) Describe one way in which nationalism posed a challenge to the Austro-Hungarian Empire as depicted on the map.**\n\n**(C) Explain one long-term political consequence for Europe that resulted from the nationalist tensions within multi-ethnic empires like Austria-Hungary.**\n\n---\n\n### **Answer EITHER Question 3 OR Question 4.**\n\n### **Question 3**\n\n**(A) Identify one way that states in 19th-century Europe promoted a unified national identity among their populations.**\n\n**(B) Explain how the method you identified in Part A helped to foster a sense of nationalism.**\n\n**(C) Explain one way in which European nationalism was used to justify imperialism in the late 19th century.**\n\n### **Question 4**\n\n**(A) Describe one way in which the French Revolution contributed to the development of nationalism as a political force in Europe.**\n\n**(B) Explain one way that industrialization contributed to the growth of nationalism in 19th-century Europe.**\n\n**(C) Explain one significant political change that occurred in the European balance of power as a direct result of nationalism between 1850 and 1900.**\n\n---\n### **Scoring Guide & Teacher's Key**\n\nThis section provides examples of acceptable answers to guide students and teachers.\n\n**Question 1 (Bismarck)**\n*   **(A) Identify:** A correct answer would identify Bismarck's argument that military force and power (\"iron and blood\") are more effective for state-building than liberalism, speeches, or parliamentary decisions.\n*   **(B) Explain:** A good explanation would connect Bismarck's speech to the failure of the liberal Revolutions of 1848 (the \"great mistake\"). The Frankfurt Parliament's attempt to unify Germany through a constitution and diplomacy failed, leading figures like Bismarck to conclude that only Prussia's industrial and military might could overcome Austrian resistance and the reluctance of smaller German states.\n*   **(C) Explain:** An effective explanation could point to:\n    *   **The Unification of Italy:** Count Cavour of Piedmont-Sardinia used diplomacy and war (the Austro-Sardinian War, Franco-Prussian War) to annex Italian-speaking territories, reflecting a policy of *realpolitik* similar to Bismarck's.\n    *   **The Meiji Restoration in Japan:** The Meiji government used military force to consolidate power, abolish the feudal system, and build a modern, centralized state capable of resisting Western imperialism, mirroring the \"iron and blood\" focus on state power.\n\n**Question 2 (Map of Austria-Hungary)**\n*   **(A) Identify:** A correct answer would identify any non-ruling ethnic group, such as Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Serbs, Croats, or Romanians.\n*   **(B) Describe:** A solid description would detail how a specific group's desire for self-determination challenged the empire's unity. For example, Hungarian (Magyar) nationalism led to constant pressure on the Austrian crown, resulting in the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, which created a dual monarchy but failed to satisfy the demands of Slavic and other minorities. Or, Serbian nationalism in the south agitated for unification with the independent state of Serbia, creating instability.\n*   **(C) Explain:** A strong explanation would connect these internal tensions to a major long-term consequence:\n    *   **The outbreak of World War I:** The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by a Serbian nationalist in Sarajevo was the immediate spark for the war. This act was a direct result of the tensions between the empire and Slavic nationalist movements.\n    *   **The collapse of empires and creation of new states:** After WWI, nationalist principles (e.g., Wilson's Fourteen Points) led to the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian empires and the creation of new nation-states like Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Poland.\n\n**Question 3 (State-promoted Nationalism)**\n*   **(A) Identify:** Correct methods include the establishment of public education systems, the creation of national anthems and flags, the promotion of a standard national language, or the construction of national monuments and holidays.\n*   **(B) Explain:** The explanation should link the method to the outcome. For instance, \"Public schools fostered nationalism by teaching all children a standardized national history and language. This created a shared cultural narrative and sense of collective identity, replacing local or regional loyalties with loyalty to the nation-state.\"\n*   **(C) Explain:** A good explanation connects national pride to imperialist motives:\n    *   **National Prestige:** Countries like Germany and Italy sought colonies to prove they were great powers, on par with Britain and France (a \"place in the sun\").\n    *   **Social Darwinism:** Some thinkers applied Darwin's theories to nations, arguing that stronger, \"fitter\" nations had a natural right or duty to dominate weaker ones, framing imperialism as a nationalistic struggle for survival.\n\n**Question 4 (Origins and Effects of Nationalism)**\n*   **(A) Describe:** A good description would focus on how the French Revolution established the idea of popular sovereignty—that the nation is composed of its citizens, not a monarch. The *levée en masse* (mass conscription) created a citizen's army fighting for the \"nation\" (la patrie) rather than a king, spreading this idea across Europe through the Napoleonic Wars.\n*   **(B) Explain:** A strong explanation would link industrialization to nationalism:\n    *   **Economic Unity:** Industrialization required large, unified internal markets. The removal of internal tariffs (like the German *Zollverein*) and the building of national railways and telegraphs physically and economically bound people into a single national unit.\n    *   **Economic Competition:** Industrialization fueled intense economic competition between European states, which in turn promoted nationalism as citizens took pride in their country's industrial output and economic strength.\n*   **(C) Explain:** An effective explanation would identify a major shift in power:\n    *   **The Rise of Germany:** The unification of Germany in 1871 created a new, powerful industrial and military giant in Central Europe, dramatically altering the balance of power that had existed since the Congress of Vienna. This directly challenged the traditional dominance of France, Austria, and Russia.\n    *   **The Decline of Austria:** The rise of Italian and German nationalism directly led to Austria losing its influence in both regions, weakening it significantly and re-orienting its focus toward the volatile Balkans."

For example:\n        *   It marked the end of French dominance on the European continent, which had been a feature of politics since the time of Louis XIV and Napoleon. The proclamation taking place at Versailles was a deliberate humiliation of France.\n        *   It created a new, powerful industrial and military rival to Great Britain, setting the stage for future naval and colonial competition.\n        *   It displaced the Austrian Empire as the preeminent German-speaking power in Central Europe, solidifying Prussia's leadership.\n\n*   **(C) Explain ONE way that nationalism challenged existing multi-ethnic empires...**\n    *   A correct response would explain how nationalist movements created internal instability or led to the decline of empires like the Austro-Hungarian or Ottoman Empires. For example:\n        *   In the Austro-Hungarian Empire, ethnic nationalism among Czechs, Serbs, Croats, and other Slavic groups led to constant demands for autonomy or independence, weakening the central government and ultimately leading to the crisis that started World War I.\n        *   In the Ottoman Empire, nationalist movements in the Balkans (e.g., in Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria) led to a series of revolts and wars throughout the 19th century, causing the empire to lose territory and be labeled the \"Sick Man of Europe.\"\n        *   Irish nationalism within the British Empire led to persistent calls for \"Home Rule\" and political movements that challenged British authority in Ireland.\n\n---\n\n### **SAQ Set 2: The Ideologies of Nation-Building**\n\n**Stimulus:**\n\n“The great questions of the day will not be decided by speeches and majority decisions—that was the great mistake of 1848 and 1849—but by iron and blood.\n...\nPrussia must concentrate its strength and hold it for the favorable moment, which has already come and gone several times.

For example:\n        *   Bismarck provoked the Franco-Prussian War through the Ems Dispatch, using military conflict as a deliberate tool to rally the southern German states to the cause of unification under Prussia.\n        *   He engaged in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 to decisively remove Austrian influence from German affairs, using Prussia's superior military and industrial strength to settle the question of leadership.\n        *   He collected taxes to fund the military against the will of the Prussian parliament, demonstrating his belief that state power and military readiness were more important than liberal \"majority decisions.\"\n\n*   **(C) Explain ONE way Bismarck's nationalism differed from French revolutionary nationalism...**\n    *   A correct response must draw a clear contrast between the two ideologies. For example:\n        *   Bismarck's nationalism was conservative and authoritarian, based on the power of the monarchy, the state, and the military (*Realpolitik*), whereas French revolutionary nationalism was liberal and based on the idea of popular sovereignty, individual rights, and the will of the people (\"the nation\").\n        *   Bismarck's goal was to unify a nation-state under the existing Prussian elite and monarch, preserving the traditional social hierarchy. In contrast, French nationalism was revolutionary and sought to overthrow the old monarchical and aristocratic order in favor of a new republic of citizens.\n\n---\n\n### **SAQ Set 3: Nationalism as a Divisive Force**\n\n**Stimulus:**\n\n![Map showing the diverse ethnic groups within the Austro-Hungarian Empire around 1910.](https://www.westpoint.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/academics/academic_departments/history/WWI/WWI%20%285%29.jpg)\n\n*Ethnic Groups of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, c. 1910*\n\n**(A) Based on the map, identify ONE challenge that the government of Austria-Hungary faced in the late 19th century.**\n\n**(B) Explain ONE political effect of the challenge identified in Part A within the Austro-Hungarian Empire.**\n\n**(C) Explain ONE way that a non-European state in the 19th or early 20th century attempted to create a sense of national identity.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Scoring Guide/Teacher's Key for Set 3:**\n\n*   **(A) Identify ONE challenge...**\n    *   A correct response must use the map as evidence to identify the primary challenge:\n        *   The Austro-Hungarian Empire was not a homogenous nation-state but a multi-ethnic empire composed of numerous distinct groups (Germans, Magyars, Czechs, Poles, Serbs, etc.).\n        *   The government had to rule over a diverse population with different languages, cultures, and growing nationalist aspirations, making centralized rule extremely difficult.\n\n*   **(B) Explain ONE political effect of the challenge...**\n    *   A correct response would describe a specific political outcome of the empire's multi-ethnic character. For example:\n        *   The *Ausgleich* (Compromise of 1867) was a direct result of Magyar (Hungarian) nationalism. It created the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary, giving Hungarians significant autonomy but alienating other Slavic groups who were not granted similar privileges.\n        *   Nationalist movements among groups like the Czechs and South Slavs led to constant political agitation for their own self-rule, which destabilized the empire from within and led to political gridlock.\n        *   The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 was a direct result of Serbian nationalism within the empire, demonstrating how these tensions could lead to international conflict.\n\n*   **(C) Explain ONE way a non-European state attempted to create a sense of national identity...**\n    *   A correct response would provide an example from outside of Europe, showing an understanding of nationalism as a global phenomenon. For example:\n        *   In Meiji Japan, the government promoted a national identity centered on the Emperor, Shintoism, and a common Japanese ethnicity. This was reinforced through a standardized education system and military conscription, creating loyalty to the new centralized state.\n        *   In the Ottoman Empire, leaders promoted a new identity of \"Ottomanism\" in the 19th century, which tried to create a common citizenship for all subjects regardless of ethnicity or religion in order to counter the rise of ethnic nationalism.\n        *   In late Qing China, reformers and revolutionaries (like Sun Yat-sen) promoted a new Han Chinese nationalist identity in opposition to the ruling Manchu dynasty, arguing that the nation needed to be unified to resist Western and Japanese imperialism."
