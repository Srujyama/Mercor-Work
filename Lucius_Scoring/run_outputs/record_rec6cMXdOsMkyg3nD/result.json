We will use a hypothesis test for the difference between two population proportions.\n\n#### 1. Define the Null and Alternative Hypotheses\n\nLet \\( p_1 \\) be the population proportion of ball bearings with a diameter less than 2.20 cm from the existing production line.\nLet \\( p_2 \\) be the population proportion of ball bearings with a diameter less than 2.20 cm from the new production line.\n\n*   **Null Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\))**\n    *   **In words:** The proportion of ball bearings with a diameter less than 2.20 cm from the existing production line is equal to the proportion from the new production line.\n    *   **In mathematical terms:** \\(H_0: p_1 = p_2\\) or \\(H_0: p_1 - p_2 = 0\\)\n\n*   **Alternative Hypothesis (\\(H_a\\))**\n    *   **In words:** The proportion of ball bearings with a diameter less than 2.20 cm from the existing production line is not equal to the proportion from the new production line.\n    *   **In mathematical terms:** \\(H_a: p_1 \\neq p_2\\) or \\(H_a: p_1 - p_2 \\neq 0\\)\n\nThis is a two-tailed test because we are checking for any difference between the two proportions, not whether one is specifically greater or less than the other.\n\n#### 2. Identify the Level of Significance\n\nThe level of significance, as stated in the problem, is:\n**α = 0.05**\n\n#### 3. Include the Test Statistic and the P-value\n\nThe Python script in Step 2 calculates the necessary values from the unique sample data. Based on the output provided:\n\n*   **Test Statistic:** The calculated z-test statistic is **-3.56**.\n*   **P-value:** The calculated two-tailed P-value is **0.0004**.\n\nSince our alternative hypothesis (\\(H_a: p_1 \\neq p_2\\)) is two-tailed, the P-value provided by the Python script (0.0004) is the correct one to use for this test.\n\n#### 4. Provide a Conclusion and Interpretation\n\n**Decision Rule:** We compare the P-value to the level of significance (α).\n*   If P-value ≤ α, we reject the null hypothesis.\n*   If P-value > α, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n**Application:**\n*   P-value = 0.0004\n*   α = 0.05\n\nSince **0.0004 ≤ 0.05**, we **reject the null hypothesis**.\n\n**Interpretation:**\nAt the 0.05 level of significance, there is sufficient statistical evidence to reject the factory's claim that the proportions of ball bearings with diameters less than 2.20 cm are the same for the existing and new production processes. The data suggests that there is a statistically significant difference between the two production lines in terms of the proportion of ball bearings produced with a diameter under 2.20 cm."

We will use a hypothesis test for the difference between two population proportions.\n\n### 1. Null and Alternative Hypotheses\n\nThe hypotheses are defined to test the claim that the two proportions are equal. Let p₁ be the population proportion of ball bearings with a diameter less than 2.20 cm from the existing production line, and let p₂ be the population proportion for the new production line.\n\n*   **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The proportion of ball bearings with a diameter less than 2.20 cm from the existing process is the same as the proportion from the new process.\n    *   In mathematical terms: **H₀: p₁ = p₂** (or **p₁ - p₂ = 0**)\n\n*   **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):** The proportion of ball bearings with a diameter less than 2.20 cm from the existing process is different from the proportion from the new process.\n    *   In mathematical terms: **Hₐ: p₁ ≠ p₂** (or **p₁ - p₂ ≠ 0**)\n\nThis is a two-tailed test because we are checking for any difference, not a specific direction (e.g., greater than or less than).\n\n### 2. Level of Significance\n\nThe level of significance, or alpha (α), is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. As stated in the problem description:\n\n*   **α = 0.05**\n\n### 3. Test Statistic and P-value\n\nThe Python script in Step 2 calculates the necessary statistics based on the unique sample data generated in Step 1. The output from the script provides the following values:\n\n*   **Test Statistic:** z = -3.56\n*   **P-value:** 0.0004\n\nSince our alternative hypothesis (Hₐ: p₁ ≠ p₂) corresponds to a two-tailed test, the two-tailed P-value provided by the Python output is the correct one to use for our analysis.\n\n### 4. Conclusion and Interpretation\n\nTo make a decision, we compare the P-value to the level of significance (α).\n\n*   **Decision Rule:** If the P-value is less than or equal to α, we reject the null hypothesis. If the P-value is greater than α, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n*   **Comparison:** P-value (0.0004) ≤ α (0.05)\n\n*   **Conclusion:** **The null hypothesis should be rejected.**\n\n*   **Interpretation:** Because the P-value of 0.0004 is less than the significance level of 0.05, we have statistically significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This means that we can conclude there is a significant difference between the proportion of ball bearings with diameters less than 2.20 cm produced by the existing manufacturing process and the proportion produced by the new process. The factory's claim that the two proportions are the same is not supported by the sample data."

Null and Alternative Hypotheses\n\nThe first step in a hypothesis test is to define the null and alternative hypotheses. The null hypothesis (H₀) represents the statement of no difference or no effect, which aligns with the factory's claim. The alternative hypothesis (Hₐ) represents the statement that there is a difference.\n\n*   **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The proportion of ball bearings with a diameter less than 2.20 cm from the existing process (p₁) is the same as the proportion from the new process (p₂).\n    *   In mathematical terms: **H₀: p₁ = p₂** or **H₀: p₁ - p₂ = 0**\n\n*   **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):** The proportion of ball bearings with a diameter less than 2.20 cm from the existing process (p₁) is not the same as the proportion from the new process (p₂).\n    *   In mathematical terms: **Hₐ: p₁ ≠ p₂** or **Hₐ: p₁ - p₂ ≠ 0**\n\nThis formulation results in a two-tailed test, as we are looking for any significant difference between the two proportions, whether one is greater or smaller than the other.\n\n#### 2. Level of Significance\n\nThe level of significance, denoted by alpha (α), is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. For this analysis, the specified level of significance is:\n\n*   **α = 0.05**\n\nThis value is the threshold for determining statistical significance.
