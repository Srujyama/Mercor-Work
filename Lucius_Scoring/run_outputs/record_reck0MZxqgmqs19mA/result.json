      "output_text": "Of course. Here's a breakdown of how long a person can hold their breath underwater, from the average person to the absolute elite.\n\nThe answer varies dramatically depending on training, genetics, and preparation.\n\n### 1. The Average, Untrained Person\nFor most people with no training, just taking a deep breath and going underwater in a pool, the time is typically between **30 seconds and 2 minutes**.\n\nThe strong, almost painful urge to breathe that you feel is not actually from a lack of oxygen, but from the buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2) in your blood, which triggers your brain's respiratory center.\n\n### 2. Trained Athletes (Freedivers, Synchronized Swimmers)\nWith dedicated training, people can dramatically increase their breath-hold time. Elite freedivers can comfortably hold their breath for **5 to 8 minutes** in a relaxed, static state (called \"static apnea\").\n\nTheir training focuses on two main things:\n*   **Increasing CO2 tolerance:** They train their bodies to ignore the screaming signals from the CO2 buildup.\n*   **Lowering metabolism:** Through intense relaxation and meditation techniques, they slow their heart rate and reduce their body's oxygen consumption to an absolute minimum.\n\n### 3. The World Records (The Absolute Limit of Human Potential)\n\nThis is where things get truly incredible. The official world records are separated into two categories:\n\n#### **Static Apnea (No pure oxygen beforehand)**\nThis involves holding your breath after breathing normal air.\n\n*   The current men's world record is **11 minutes and 35 seconds**, held by Stéphane Mifsud.\n*   The current women's world record is **9 minutes and 2 seconds**, held by Natalia Molchanova.\n\n#### **Static Apnea with Pure Oxygen**\nThis is the absolute longest a human has ever held their breath. Before the attempt, the person breathes 100% pure oxygen for up to 30 minutes. This \"oxygen packing\" saturates the blood and tissues, allowing the body to go for an astonishingly long time before vital organs are at risk.\n\n*   The current Guinness World Record is **24 minutes and 37 seconds**, set by Budimir Šobat.\n\n---\n\n### What Makes This Possible? The Science\n\nTwo key factors allow humans to hold their breath for so long:\n\n1.  **The Mammalian Dive Reflex:** This is an incredible set of automatic physiological responses that kick in when your face is submerged in cold water.\n    *   **Bradycardia:** Your heart rate slows down significantly to conserve oxygen.\n    *   **Vasoconstriction:** Blood vessels in your extremities (arms and legs) constrict, directing oxygen-rich blood to your most vital organs, the brain and heart.\n    *   **Spleen Effect:** The spleen, which stores red blood cells, contracts and releases its reserve into the bloodstream, increasing the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity.\n\n2.  **Mental Control:** A huge part of freediving is the ability to achieve a state of total mental calm. Panic and stress burn through oxygen at a rapid rate.\n\n### **Extremely Important Safety Warning**\n\n**Never, ever practice breath-holding alone in water.**\n\nThe biggest danger is a **hypoxic blackout** (or \"shallow water blackout\"). This happens when oxygen levels in the brain drop so low that you simply pass out without warning. There is no struggle and no feeling of panic—you are conscious one moment and unconscious the next. If you are alone when this happens, you will drown. It can happen to even the most elite swimmers and in very shallow water, including a bathtub."

      "output_text": "Of course. Here's a straightforward breakdown of how long a person can hold their breath underwater.\n\nIt varies dramatically between an average, untrained person and a world-class professional.\n\n### The Short Answer\n\n*   **For an average, healthy person:** Most people can comfortably hold their breath for **30 to 90 seconds**. This is without any training or special techniques.\n*   **With a bit of practice:** It's relatively easy for most people to train themselves to hold their breath for a solid **2 to 3 minutes**.\n\n### The Elite and World Record Level\n\nThis is where it gets incredible. Professional freedivers use a combination of intense training, mental discipline, and an understanding of their own physiology to achieve times that seem superhuman.\n\n*   **Elite Freedivers (No Pure Oxygen):** The world record for \"static apnea\" (holding your breath while floating face down, not moving) without breathing pure oxygen beforehand is **11 minutes and 35 seconds** by Stéphane Mifsud.\n*   **World Record (With Pure Oxygen):** The official Guinness World Record, which allows breathing 100% pure oxygen for up to 30 minutes beforehand, is a staggering **24 minutes and 37 seconds**, set by Budimir Šobat. Breathing pure oxygen saturates the blood, allowing for much longer times.\n\n---\n\n### What's Happening in Your Body? (The \"Why\")\n\nThe ability to hold your breath isn't just about willpower; it's about physiology.\n\n1.  **The Urge to Breathe:** The primary trigger that makes you gasp for air isn't a lack of oxygen (O₂), but rather a **buildup of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in your blood**. As CO₂ levels rise, your blood becomes more acidic, and your brain stem sends a powerful, non-negotiable signal to your diaphragm to contract. This is what causes that burning, panicky feeling.\n\n2.  **The Mammalian Dive Reflex:** Humans, like whales and seals, have a built-in set of reflexes that activate when our face is submerged in cold water. This helps us conserve oxygen:\n    *   **Heart Rate Slows:** Your heart rate can drop significantly (a process called bradycardia) to reduce oxygen consumption.\n    *   **Blood Shifts:** Blood vessels in your limbs constrict, redirecting oxygen-rich blood away from your extremities and toward your vital organs, primarily the heart and brain.\n\n### Key Factors that Determine How Long You Can Hold Your Breath\n\n*   **Training:** This is the biggest factor. Freedivers train their bodies to tolerate high levels of CO₂ and lower levels of O₂. They also practice meditation and relaxation to keep their heart rate extremely low, burning minimal oxygen.\n*   **Relaxation:** Panic is the enemy. Any stress, fear, or movement burns oxygen rapidly. Being completely calm and still is essential for long breath-holds.\n*   **Genetics & Physiology:** Things like lung capacity and the size of your spleen (which stores and releases oxygen-rich red blood cells) can play a role.\n*   **Water Temperature:** Cold water triggers a stronger Mammalian Dive Reflex, which is beneficial.\n*   **Preparation:** The techniques used right before the breath-hold, like the controversial practice of hyperventilation or breathing pure oxygen, make a massive difference.\n\n---\n\n### **A Critical Safety Warning**\n\n**Never, ever practice holding your breath underwater alone.**\n\nThe biggest danger is a **shallow water blackout**, where you pass out from a lack of oxygen to the brain. Because trained individuals can suppress the CO₂ urge to breathe, they can run out of oxygen without warning and simply faint underwater. Without someone there to immediately pull you up, this is fatal. Always practice with a trained buddy."

      "output_text": "Excellent question. The answer varies dramatically depending on who \"a person\" is—an average person just trying it out, or a world-class freediver.\n\nHere’s a breakdown from the average person to the absolute limits of human potential.\n\n### 1. The Average, Untrained Person\n\nFor a healthy person without any specific training, just taking a deep breath and going underwater, the time is typically between **30 and 90 seconds**.\n\n*   **Around 30 seconds:** Most people start to feel a strong, uncomfortable urge to breathe.\n*   **Around 60 seconds:** This is achievable for many, but it requires staying calm and still. The diaphragm will start to contract involuntarily, which is the body's signal that carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are getting high.\n*   **Up to 90 seconds:** This is a very good time for an untrained person but is near the upper limit for most without practice.\n\n### 2. Trained Breath-Holders (Freedivers)\n\nThis is where the numbers start to get incredible. Through intense physical and mental training, freedivers can dramatically extend their breath-hold times.\n\n*   **Experienced Freedivers:** It's common for competitive freedivers to hold their breath for **4 to 7 minutes**.\n*   **Elite Freedivers:** The top athletes in the world push this even further, regularly exceeding **8 to 10 minutes** in \"static apnea\" (holding their breath while floating face down and motionless).\n\n### 3. The World Records\n\nThe official world records are mind-boggling and demonstrate the absolute peak of human adaptation. It's crucial to distinguish between two types of records:\n\n*   **Without 100% Oxygen beforehand (Pure Breath-Hold):**\n    *   The men's record is **11 minutes and 35 seconds** by Stéphane Mifsud.\n\n*   **With 100% Oxygen beforehand:**\n    *   Breathing pure oxygen for up to 30 minutes before the attempt flushes nitrogen from the lungs and \"super-saturates\" the blood with oxygen, allowing for much longer times.\n    *   The current Guinness World Record is **24 minutes and 37.36 seconds** by Budimir Šobat.\n\n---\n\n### What Makes the Difference? The Science Behind It\n\nIt's not just about having big lungs. The ability to hold your breath for a long time depends on three key factors:\n\n1.  **The Urge to Breathe:** The primary trigger to breathe isn't a lack of oxygen (O2), but the **buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2)** in your blood. Freedivers train their bodies to tolerate extremely high levels of CO2, pushing past the discomfort that would make an average person gasp for air.\n2.  **Oxygen Conservation:** Trained divers are masters of relaxation. By slowing their heart rate and remaining perfectly still, they drastically reduce their body's oxygen consumption.\n3.  **The Mammalian Dive Reflex:** All mammals, including humans, have a fascinating set of automatic responses when our faces are submerged in cold water. This reflex helps us survive underwater by:\n    *   **Slowing the heart rate** (bradycardia).\n    *   **Shifting blood flow** away from the limbs and toward the vital organs like the brain and heart (peripheral vasoconstriction).\n    *   This reflex is a powerful, natural oxygen-saving mechanism.\n\n### A CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING\n\nIt is extremely dangerous to practice breath-holding alone. A common risk is **Shallow Water Blackout (Hypoxic Blackout)**, where a person loses consciousness underwater due to a lack of oxygen to the brain. This happens suddenly and without warning.\n\n**Never, ever practice breath-holding or freediving without a trained and attentive buddy watching you at all times.**"

      "output_text": "### The average person can hold their breath for 30 to 90 seconds, but this duration can be extended to several minutes with training.\n\nAn untrained individual can typically hold their breath underwater for a period ranging from 30 to 90 seconds. This time can vary based on factors like fitness level, lung capacity, and any underlying health conditions. With dedicated training, such as that practiced by free divers, it is possible to significantly extend this time.\n\n**World Records and Human Potential:**\n\nThe limits of human breath-holding are demonstrated by impressive world records. The current Guinness World Record for the longest time holding one's breath underwater is held by Budimir Šobat of Croatia, who on March 27, 2021, held his breath for 24 minutes and 37 seconds. It is important to note that this was achieved after inhaling pure oxygen, a technique that significantly boosts the body's oxygen stores.\n\nThe world record for holding one's breath without prior oxygen inhalation is 11 minutes and 54 seconds, set by Branko Petrović. These extraordinary feats are the result of years of rigorous physical and mental training.\n\n**Physiological Factors and Adaptations:**\n\nSeveral physiological factors influence how long a person can hold their breath. The body's urge to breathe is primarily triggered by rising carbon dioxide levels in the blood, not a lack of oxygen. Training can help individuals tolerate higher levels of CO2 and lower levels of oxygen.\n\nRemarkable human adaptations for underwater life have been observed in the Bajau people of Southeast Asia. They have genetically larger spleens, which act as a biological scuba tank by storing oxygenated red blood cells. This allows them to spend significant amounts of time diving for food.\n\n**Risks and Safety:**\n\nAttempting to hold your breath for extended periods, especially underwater, can be dangerous. The primary risk is a \"shallow water blackout\" or hypoxic blackout, which is a loss of consciousness caused by oxygen deprivation. This can occur without warning and can lead to drowning, even in shallow water. It is strongly advised to never practice breath-holding alone in the water."

      "output_text": "### On Average, a Person Can Hold Their Breath Underwater for 30 to 90 Seconds\n\nFor the average, untrained individual, the ability to hold one's breath underwater is typically limited to between 30 and 90 seconds. This duration can be influenced by a variety of factors including overall fitness, lung capacity, and even genetics.\n\nWhen a person holds their breath, the body continues to consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide. The overwhelming urge to breathe is not primarily triggered by a lack of oxygen, but rather by the buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood. This accumulation of CO2 sends strong signals to the brain, resulting in involuntary diaphragm contractions and a burning sensation in the lungs, compelling the person to take a breath.\n\nPushing past this natural urge can lead to dizziness, lightheadedness, and reduced motor control. In extreme cases, oxygen deprivation, known as hypoxia, can cause a blackout, which is particularly dangerous underwater and can lead to drowning.\n\n### World Records and Extreme Capabilities\n\nWhile the average person's ability is limited, trained professionals in the discipline of freediving have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities, pushing the boundaries of human potential.\n\nThe current world record for the longest time holding breath underwater with the aid of pure oxygen beforehand (static apnea with 100% oxygen) is a staggering 29 minutes and 3 seconds, achieved by Vitomir Maričić of Croatia on June 14, 2025. It is important to note that pre-breathing pure oxygen significantly extends breath-holding time by increasing the body's oxygen stores.\n\nEven without the assistance of pure oxygen, the limits of human endurance are remarkable. The world record for static apnea without prior oxygen inhalation is 11 minutes and 54 seconds, set by Branko Petrović of Serbia.\n\nThese incredible feats are the result of intense physical and mental training. Freedivers learn to lower their heart rate, conserve oxygen more efficiently, and mentally withstand the powerful urge to breathe. Some groups of people, like the Bajau people of Southeast Asia, have even developed physiological adaptations, such as larger spleens which act as a biological scuba tank by storing oxygenated red blood cells, allowing them to spend significant time underwater."

      "output_text": "### Breath-Holding Capabilities: From the Average Person to World Record Holders\n\nThe length of time a person can hold their breath underwater varies dramatically, ranging from under a minute for an average individual to staggering feats of endurance by trained professionals. While most untrained adults can hold their breath for approximately 30 to 90 seconds, elite free divers have pushed the boundaries of human capability, setting records that extend for many minutes.\n\nThe current world record for the longest time holding breath underwater, with the assistance of prior pure oxygen breathing, is a remarkable 29 minutes and 3 seconds, achieved by Croatian free diver Vitomir Maričić in June 2025. This method, known as oxygen-assisted static apnea, involves inhaling pure oxygen for a period before the breath-hold, which significantly increases the body's oxygen stores.\n\nIn the realm of unassisted breath-holding, the world record for static apnea stands at an impressive 11 minutes and 54 seconds, set by Branko Petrović of Serbia. This feat was accomplished without the use of supplementary oxygen, relying solely on the diver's natural physiological capacity and rigorous training.\n\n#### The Physiological Factors at Play\n\nSeveral physiological factors contribute to an individual's ability to hold their breath. The mammalian diving reflex, an innate response in mammals, is a key element. When the face is submerged in cold water, the heart rate slows down, and blood vessels in the extremities constrict, redirecting oxygenated blood to the vital organs, particularly the brain and heart.\n\nFurthermore, some groups of people, like the Bajau of Southeast Asia, have demonstrated unique physiological adaptations for a marine lifestyle. Research has shown that the Bajau have genetically larger spleens, which act as a biological scuba tank by storing oxygenated red blood cells. This allows them to spend remarkable amounts of time underwater.\n\n#### Training and Risks\n\nElite free divers undergo extensive training to improve their breath-holding capabilities. This includes physical conditioning to enhance lung capacity and tolerance to carbon dioxide buildup, as well as mental techniques to stay calm and reduce oxygen consumption.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to note the significant risks associated with prolonged breath-holding. Pushing past the body's natural urge to breathe can lead to a loss of consciousness, known as a shallow water blackout, which can be fatal if the person is not rescued promptly. The practice can also put considerable stress on the cardiovascular system. Therefore, attempting to significantly extend one's breath-hold time should only be done under the supervision of trained professionals."
