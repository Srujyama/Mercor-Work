      "output_text": "Here are the answers to the questions:\n\n7.  **a) I went to the store, and I bought some milk.**\n    A compound sentence consists of two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (like \"and,\" \"but,\" or \"or\"). Both \"I went to the store\" and \"I bought some milk\" can stand alone as complete sentences. Option (d) is also a correct example of a compound sentence.\n\n8.  **a) to, with**\n    The correct sentence is: \"She went **to** the park to play **with** her friends.\" \"To\" is a preposition indicating direction, and \"with\" is a preposition indicating accompaniment.\n\n9.  **b) I will go to the library tomorrow.**\n    The future tense indicates an action that has not yet happened. The use of \"will go\" signifies a future action.\n\n10. **a) The cat**\n    The subject of a sentence is the person, place, thing, or idea that is performing the action. In this sentence, \"the cat\" is performing the action of chasing.\n\n11. **c) The central message or moral of the story**\n    The theme is the underlying message or main idea that the author is trying to convey through the story. It is a universal idea that goes beyond the specific plot and characters.\n\n12. **b) Love conquers all**\n    A theme is a broad, universal idea or message. \"Love conquers all\" is a statement about life or human nature that a story might explore, whereas the other options describe plot points or specific details.\n\n13. **a) Through the actions and decisions of characters**\n    The theme is typically not stated directly. Instead, it is revealed to the reader through the ways characters behave, the conflicts they face, the lessons they learn, and the consequences of their choices.\n\n14. **a) Friendship and loyalty**\n    A universal theme is an idea that is relatable to people across different cultures and time periods. Friendship and loyalty are concepts understood and valued worldwide, unlike the specific history of a city or a character's preference.\n\n15. **a) The importance of honesty**\n    The passage explicitly states the lesson Sarah learned, which is that telling the truth is the best choice. This directly points to the theme of the importance of honesty.\n\n16. **b) Hard work leads to success**\n    If a story shows a character achieving their goals through effort and persistence, the central message or theme is that hard work is rewarded.\n\n17. **a) Trust and betrayal**\n    A story about a character learning to trust others would naturally explore the concepts of both placing trust in someone and the potential pain of that trust being broken (betrayal). This dynamic is central to the theme."
